                   <p> I have experince in a wide range of programming languages including C, Java, Python, Haskell, Pascal, PHP, Perl and C++. I am keen to learn new skills and to get involved with different aspects of software engineering.</p>

                    <p>For my year in industry I spent 12 months working at CERN(European Organization for Nuclear Research), as a technical student. I worked in EN-ICE-SCD section on the Quality Assurance (QA) and testing of the software produced by the section.</p>
                    
                    <p>EN-ICE-SCD is the Engineering(EN) department, In- dustrial Controls Engineering (ICE) group, SCADA Systems (SCD) section. EN-ICE provides software and a support service to the experiments for some of the control systems being used. This includes upgrades, installation and a support line.</p>
                    
                    <p>The section I was working in develops frameworks for WinCC-OA, written in C++ and CTRL, which is a C-like language. WinCC-OA, whose full name is SIMATIC WinCC Open Architecture, is a SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) system produced by ETM[3]. It can be used for small control systems that have one project running on a machine, to very large redundant control systems that are distributed across multiple projects running on any number of machines. </p>
                    
                    <p>While at CERN I worked on the Graphical User Interface (GUI) testing, automated static code analysis, automated unit testing and reviewing of the frameworks metioned above.</p>
                    
                    <p>For the GUI testing we used a tool called Squish[4]. We automaticall ran this on several virtual machines(VM) using Jenkins[5]. We then used Jira[1] to record any issues this found.</p>
                    
                    <p>I created an automated static code analysis tool for the frameworks using a tool called ConQAT[2] and automated using Python. I added some CTRL language specfic anaysis to ConQAT. I also ran some anaysis without using ConQAT and created an APEX[6] application to display this data.</p>
